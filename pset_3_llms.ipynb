    "1. **Net Zero (NZ)**: Commitments to balance GHG emissions with removal\n",
    "2. **Reduction**: Targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n",
    "3. **Other**: Other quantifiable targets (e.g., renewable energy targets)\n",

Meanwhile, in September 2015, the Republic of Azerbaijan joined the \"Sustainable Development Agenda for 2016-2030\", which was approved at the UN Summit on Sustainable Development in New York and launched the enforcement process for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (17 SDGs, 169 targets and 232 indicators). Seven of the SDGs, namely the SDG 6, SDG 7, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 15 directly deal with mitigation of environmental and climate change and other issues, and SDG 8 and SDG 9 touched upon the topic indirectly. For example, the Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It is noted in the relevant targets that the development and implementation of new innovative technologies to explore the potential of the green economy and expand its application in all countries is of great importance. The SDG 7 is about ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Target 7.2 envisages substantial increase in the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. Meanwhile, Goal 7.3 calls for doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Target 7.a. envisages enhancing international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology by 2030.\n",

    "ERROR ANALYSIS SUMMARY\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. IMPLICIT vs EXPLICIT MENTIONS (Most Common Error)\n",
    "   - The model struggles when targets are implied rather than explicitly stated\n",
    "   - Example: \"carbon neutrality\" may not be recognized as a Net Zero target\n",
    "   - Potential fix: Augment training data with paraphrased versions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. MULTIPLE TARGETS CONFUSION\n",
    "   - When texts mention multiple target types, the model sometimes confuses them\n",
    "   - This is inherent to the multi-label nature of the problem\n",
    "   - Model may need more training examples with multiple labels\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CONTEXT DEPENDENCY\n",
    "   - Some passages reference \"the target\" without defining it\n",
    "   - Model lacks broader document context\n",
    "   - Could be addressed with longer context windows or hierarchical models\n",
    "\n",
    "4. AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE\n",
    "   - Policy documents sometimes use vague language\n",
    "   - Model cannot classify what humans would also find ambiguous\n",
    "   - Reflects genuine ambiguity in policy communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of Our Model:\n",
    "- Strong performance on explicit, well-defined targets\n",
    "- Good handling of technical climate policy terminology\n",
    "- Efficient inference with small model size\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Requires explicit mentions of target types\n",
    "- Limited by short context window (512 tokens)\n",
    "- May miss nuanced policy language\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Improvements:\n",
    "1. Data augmentation with paraphrased targets\n",
    "2. Longer context windows for better document understanding\n",
    "3. Ensemble with ClimateBERT for complementary strengths\n",
    "4. Active learning to focus on difficult examples\n",
